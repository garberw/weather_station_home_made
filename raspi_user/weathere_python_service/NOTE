"Using the second (I2C 0) port on a Raspberry Pi"

next line is always a software i2c bus;

dtparm=i2c-gpio ... etc ...


I believe this next line --IS-- in fact a hardware i2c bus;

dtparm=i2c_vc=on

pin 27 = data (SDA)

pin 28 = clock (SCL)

need 2 Kohm pull ups to 3.3V on both
(WIRING:  3.3V connected to pin 27 with resistor)
(WIRING:  3.3V connected to pin 28 with resistor)

see "/boot/overlays/README" and search for "i2c_vc";

NOTE:  says downside is you can not use camera;


This says:  "I also read that you can use I2C bus 0, which is used by the OS, but that is risky."

https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/105086/pi-zero-w-second-i2c-bus

recommends 4k7 resistors;
says hardware bus on GPIO2/3 uses 1k8 resistors;
